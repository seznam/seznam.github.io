            Isomorphic applications consist of a single application logic that is first executed at the server-side, generates the page markup, and then the application logic is executed at the client-side, automatically binds to the server-generated markup and acts like a single-page application (or a multi-page application if the client does not support JavaScript). This allows for fast load times, out-of-box support for web crawlers and greater overall user experience (or UX for short).
